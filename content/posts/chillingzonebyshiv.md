On a normal college working day when everybody is frustated about pending assignmnents and lecturs which were like sharp bouncers gone with speed of 150km\h, then after so much of tortue those aggrieved beings desire a place for some relaxation.
**So wasn't that too cheesy,formal and cringe**

Now, let's come to main topic if I had  infinte resources and infite budget to renovate cafe (then also I'll take permission lol).I would first place atleast 4 ticket wending machines from which food order can be given by placing our order same as we take ticket from ticket wending  wending machine.This will make food ordering easy and students can avoid being in long line and these will be placed on enterance.After doing this I will make that cafeteria fully air conditioned and place music system in cafeteria where music will be played whole day. Also center space will be kept empty for people who want to showcase their dance skills.everyday some different competition will be held like open mic or dance competition and winner will be allowed to eat whatever he/she wants free of cost for that whole day.
**Now that was  too far a expectation from our college to be true but yeah if I got chance I will make all these changes.**
