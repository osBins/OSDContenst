< If I would have been given infinite resources and budget and the confined space of cafeteria,
    I would have removed all the chairs and tables, closed the windows with black shutters, made the cafe pitch dark, and converted it into a planetarium environment with every requirement installed and also would have made it ZERO-G. I could have spacewalked(in a way) for as long as I had to. Anyone wishing to do the same could have also joined.
